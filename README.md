# hello-world
tutorial

Hello world, my name is Kelene. I am totally new to coding and Github. Honestly, I don't really know what I'm doing here. I don't know what I'm doing... all this information is overwhelming. But I have a feeling that this experience might be important, so I'm going to finish this tutorial. 
I just finished the penultimate semester of my master's degree. I'm currently home during the winter break. In a couple days, I'll return to NYC for my last semester. I can't wait to graduate and be free... but I wonder what comes next.
